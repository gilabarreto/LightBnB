# LightBnB

LightBnB allows home owners to rent out their homes to people on vacation, creating an alternative to hotels and bed and breakfasts. 

This project is part of my Lighthouse Labs studies, practicing my back-end skills, and also Node, SQL and PostgreSQL skills.

I started this project by designing the database and creating an ERD for the tables, then created the database and the tables using the ERD.
After that, was added some fake data to the database to make testing queries easier, then some queries were written.
Finally, I connected the database to a javascript application so that I could interact with the data from a web page.
